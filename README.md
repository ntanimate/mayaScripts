PURPOSE:
These scripts were created using version Maya 2022 and Python 3. I am a beginner coder and 3D animator so any feedback is welcome. These scripts have helped me with faster workflows in my classes. All scripts can be middle mouse dragged and converted into shelf buttons for easy access.

GOALS:
As an aspiring TD in production or gaming I took classes through CGMA to learn Maya and other 3D animation software. The code is heavily commented because they are intended as tools for animation or modeling students who do not typically look at the MEL user interface. I created small scripts with the intent of solving a few challenges I faced in Maya as well as optimizing the workflow:

GOAL 1: As a beginner, the Maya interface has a lot of new tools. An example is the image plane which you cannot pull up by searching the help menu in Maya. I created the front facing camera view image plane script so I wouldn't have to remember where the image plane button is located. <b>This will help me or other beginners new to Maya when we can't remember where this tool is that is often used for setting up a model.</b>

GOAL 2: <b>Following goal 1, the same script helps with creating efficiency of tools themselves and interdependencies of tools to save time.</b> The script was applicable to the following scenarios from class and outside class:
  - Scenario 1: Using the image plane laying out vertices or blocking out anatomically correct shapes for a model like a robot
  - Scenario 2: Using this script in conjunction with the CV curve tool to quickly trace bottles for a scene. If I need to make quite a few different bottles, this script will help shorten the setup time.
  - Scenario 3: Using this script for modeling a lotion bottle to block out the shape using geometry

GOAL 3: <b>The script for mixamo T-rig pose was created to shorten set up time for animating my robot character using a mixamo rig.</b> Since the characters have to always start in T-pose, this script will come in handy for avoding repition of manual set up steps. I wanted to also script the mapping assignment of joints in humanIK but this script was more complex so unfortunately this would have to be done in a refactor once I understood more.
