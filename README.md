PURPOSE:
These scripts were created using version Maya 2022 and Python 3. I am a beginner coder and 3D animator so any feedback is welcome. These scripts have helped me with faster workflows in my classes.  

GOALS:
As an aspiring TD in production or gaming I took classes through CGMA to learn Maya and other 3D animation software. The code is heavily commented because they are intended as tools for animation or modeling students who do not typically look at the MEL user interface. I created these scripts with the intent of solving a few issues in Maya:

1. As a beginner, the Maya interface has a lot of new tools. These tools easily get mixed up for actions I need to take repeatedly. This will help me or other new beginners when I can't remember where a tool is.

2. I strive for efficiency of tools themselves and interdependencies of tools to save time. An example is the front view camera image plane tool script used for the following scenarios from class and outside class:
  - Scenario 1: Using the image plane laying out vertices or blocking out anatomically correct shapes for a model like a robot
  - Scenario 2: Using this script in conjunction with the CV curve tool to quickly trace bottles for a scene. If I need to make quite a few different bottles, this script will help shorten the setup time.
  - Scenario 3: Using this script for modeling a lotion bottle to block out the shape using geometry

3. The script for mixamo T-rig pose was created to shorten set up time for animating my robot character using a mixamo rig. Since the characters have to always start in T-pose, this script will come in handy for repeating manual set up steps. I wanted to also script the mapping assignment of joints in humanIK but this script was more complex so unfortunately this part is still done manually.
