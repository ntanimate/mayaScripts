#This python script creates an image plane and positions the image in front camera view in Maya 2022. 
#Make sure the image is saved in the file path maya/projects/projectName/images folder
#Before running the script in a new Maya scene, you must replace 'Filename' in the step below "Input file name" with the image name path, example "dispenser_bottle.png" Then copy and paste the script below #including the image path into python script window and run the script. You can also drag and drop the script to your Maya shelf but a new image path will need to be added to load a new image.

####Copy and paste Script below
import maya.cmds

#Sets camera position of image to front
cmds.imagePlane (lookThrough = "front")

#Sets type of file to 'image'. Can also be movie (1), texture (2)
cmds.setAttr('imagePlaneShape1.type',0) 

#Moves the image up 
cmds.move(0,5, 0)

#Input file name after images to load the image on the plane. Replace 'Filename' with name of image file and don't forget to include .png or .jpg
cmds.setAttr('imagePlaneShape1.imageName', 'images/Filename', type = 'string')
